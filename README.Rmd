This package gives an overview of the covid-19 situation in the world.

## Installation

Unfortunately you can't install this package from CRAN. So you will have to rely on github!


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Iarima/covidPlots")
```
## Example

This package has three functions. First one returns global covid-19 data as a dataframe.
```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(covidPlots)
covidData <- covidPlots::updateCovid()
head(covidData)
```

The second one plots a world map colored by the number of total cases, total deaths or total recovers.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
covidPlots::worldCovidPlot(day = "2020-10-1",type = "cases")
```

Lastly, the third function uses the data from updateCovid to draw time series of new cases, new deaths, and new recovers for a country.

```{r}
covidPlots::covidTimeSeries(country = 'egypt',min.date = '2020-01-22',max.date = '2020-10-2')
```
